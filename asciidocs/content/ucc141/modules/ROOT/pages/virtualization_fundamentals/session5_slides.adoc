=== Session 5: Virtual Network Modes in Hypervisors

'''

== The Virtual Switchboard

VMs behave like separate computers, but they need a network connection.

* **The Hypervisor:** Acts as a "Smart Switchboard".
* **The Choice:** You decide who the VM can talk to:
** The Internet?
** The Local Network (LAN)?
** Only the Host?
** Only other VMs?

'''

== 1. NAT (Network Address Translation)

**"The Home Router Mode"**

* **Concept:** VM sits behind the Host. Shares the Host's IP address to talk to the world.
* **Analogy:** Your phone on home Wi-Fi.
* **Connectivity:**
** VM -> Internet: **Yes**
** Internet -> VM: **No** (Protected)
* **Best For:** Browsing, installing updates, general use.

'''

== 2. Bridged Networking

**"The Direct Connection"**

* **Concept:** VM connects directly to the physical LAN. It looks like a separate physical device.
* **Analogy:** Plugging a laptop into the wall switch next to your PC.
* **Connectivity:**
** VM gets its own IP from the physical router.
** Full access (Inbound & Outbound).
* **Best For:** Servers (Web, Game) that need to be seen by others.

'''

== 3. Host-Only Networking

**"The Private Channel"**

* **Concept:** A private network between the **Host** and the **VM**.
* **Analogy:** A crossover cable connecting two computers directly.
* **Connectivity:**
** **No Internet Access.**
** Host can talk to VM; VM can talk to Host.
* **Best For:** Secure development, testing tools without outside interference.

'''

== 4. Internal Networking

**"The Isolated Lab"**

* **Concept:** A closed network where VMs can only talk to *other VMs*.
* **Analogy:** A sealed room with computers. No doors.
* **Connectivity:**
** No Host access. No Internet access.
** Complete isolation.
* **Best For:** Malware analysis, practicing network attacks/defense safely.

== Lab: Network Configuration

**Objective:** Configure two VMs with different modes.

. **VM1 (Host-Only):**
** Can it ping the Host? (Should be YES)
** Can it ping Google? (Should be NO)
. **VM2 (Bridged):**
** Check IP: Should be in same range as Host (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
** Can it ping the Internet? (Should be YES)

'''

== Verification & Troubleshooting

**Commands:**

* **Check IP:** `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ip addr` (Linux)
* **Check Connection:** `ping 8.8.8.8` or `ping google.com`

**Common Issues:**

* **Bridged fails?** Wi-Fi adapters sometimes reject promiscuous mode. Try Ethernet.
* **No IP?** Check if the virtual cable is "Connected" in settings.
* **Ping fails?** Host firewall might be blocking it.

== Knowledge Check

. Which mode hides the VM behind the Host?
** *NAT*
. Which mode makes the VM appear as a real device on the LAN?
** *Bridged*
. Which mode is best for dangerous malware testing?
** *Internal*
