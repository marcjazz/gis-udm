=== Session 6: Snapshots for State Management

'''

== Session Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

* Define VM snapshots and their internal mechanics.
* Create, revert, and delete snapshots safely.
* Understand snapshot trees and delta disks.
* Use snapshots to recover from configuration failures.
* Apply snapshot best practices.

'''

== 1. What Is a Snapshot?

A **snapshot** is a point-in-time record of a virtual machine’s state.

* **Captures:** Disk contents (and optionally memory/CPU state).
* **The "Undo" Button:** Allows you to return the VM to exactly how it was.
* **Speed:** Taking a snapshot is nearly instant.

'''

== 2. How it Works: Delta Disks

When you take a snapshot, the original disk is **frozen**.

**Before Snapshot:**
`[ Base Disk (Read/Write) ] <--- VM`

**After Snapshot:**
`[ Base Disk (Read-Only) ]`
`          |`
`[ Delta Disk (Read/Write) ] <--- VM`

* New changes only go into the **Delta Disk**.
* Reverting simply deletes the Delta Disk.

'''

== 3. Snapshot Trees

Snapshots can be "stacked" to create multiple points in time.

[source,text]
----
Base Disk (Original OS)
   |
   +-- Snapshot A (Software Installed)
   |       |
   |       +-- Snapshot B (Configured)
   |
   +-- Snapshot C (Experimental Setup)
----

* **Caution:** Long chains can slow down disk performance.
* Each snapshot depends on the one before it.

'''

== 4. Snapshot vs. Backup

|===
| Feature | Snapshot | Backup

| **Independence**
| No (Needs Base Disk)
| Yes (Self-contained)

| **Longevity**
| Short-term
| Long-term

| **Rollback**
| Very Fast
| Slower

| **Safe for Prod**
| Limited
| Yes
|===

**Rule:** Snapshots are *temporary checkpoints*, not permanent storage.

'''

== 5. When to Use Snapshots

**Good Use Cases:**

* Before installing new software.
* Before editing critical config files.
* Before running OS updates.
* Training labs (easy resets).

**Bad Use Cases:**

* High-traffic Databases.
* Long-term archival.
* Disaster recovery (if the physical host fails).

== 5. Snapshot Lifecycle

== 6. Lab: The "Time Travel" Recovery

**Objective:** Use a snapshot to recover a Linux VM after breaking a web server.

**Scenario:**

. Install Apache Web Server.
. Take a "Known Good" snapshot.
. Intentionally break the configuration.
. "Time travel" back to fix it.

'''

== Part 1: Setup Apache

. **Update:** `sudo apt update`
. **Install:** `sudo apt install apache2 -y`
. **Start:** `sudo systemctl start apache2`
. **Verify:** Open the VM's IP in a browser. You should see the "Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page".

'''

== Part 2: The Safety Net

**Take a Snapshot now!**

* **Name:** `Working Web Server`
* **Description:** `Apache installed and verified.`

'''

== Part 3: Sabotage

. **Edit Config:** `sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf`
. **Break it:** Change `Listen 80` to `Listen eighty`.
. **Restart:** `sudo systemctl restart apache2`
. **Check Status:** `sudo systemctl status apache2`

**Result:** The service fails. The website is down.

'''

== Part 4: Revert & Verify

. **Action:** Use the Hypervisor menu to **Revert to Snapshot**.
. **Boot:** Start the VM.
. **Check:**
** `sudo systemctl status apache2` (Should be running)
** Check browser (Should be back online)

**Outcome:** The broken configuration file was physically replaced by the version in the snapshot.

'''

== 7. Best Practices Checklist

* [ ] **Delete** snapshots once they aren't needed.
* [ ] Use **descriptive names** (e.g., "Pre-PHP-Update").
* [ ] Shut down the VM before taking snapshots for maximum stability (though "Hot" snapshots are possible).
* [ ] **Never** rely on snapshots as your only backup.
