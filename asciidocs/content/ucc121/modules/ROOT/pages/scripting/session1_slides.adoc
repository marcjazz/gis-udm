=== Session 1: Mastering the Shell Environment

'''

== What is a Shell?

A program that takes your commands and tells the operating system what to do.

**You -> Shell -> OS Kernel -> Hardware**

It is your primary interface for controlling the system. We will be using **Bash** (Bourne Again SHell).

'''

== Your Toolbox: `~/.bashrc`

An essential configuration file in your home directory.

* **Purpose:** Stores your personal customizations.
* **Execution:** Runs automatically every time you open a new terminal.
* **Rule:** After editing, you must run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply changes to your current session.

'''

== Aliases: Your Command-Line Shortcuts

Create short, memorable names for long, complex commands.

**Syntax:** `alias name='long_command'`

[source,bash]
----
# Example
alias ll='ls -alF'
----

'''

== Useful Alias Examples

[source,bash]
----
# For detailed, human-readable file listing
alias ll='ls -alFh'

# For system updates (Debian/Ubuntu)
alias update='sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'

# To quickly show all active network ports
alias ports='netstat -tulpn'
----

'''

== Functions: Super-Powered Aliases

For when an alias is not enough.

* Can contain multiple commands.
* Can accept arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.).
* Can include logic.

**Syntax:**

[source,bash]
----
function_name() {
  commands
}
----

'''

== Function Example: `mkcd`

A common workflow: create a directory, then `cd` into it.

[source,bash]
----
# Add this to your ~/.bashrc
mkcd() {
  mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"
}
----

**Usage:** `mkcd my_new_project`

'''

== Environment Variables

Dynamic, named values that programs use to configure their behavior.

* Conventionally named in `UPPERCASE`.
* View any variable with `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`.
* Set them with `export VARIABLE_NAME="value"`.

'''

== The `PATH` Variable

How does the shell find commands like `ls` or `grep`? It searches the `PATH`.

* `$PATH` is a colon-separated list of directories.
* `echo $PATH`
* To add your own script directory (e.g., `~/bin`):
`export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"`
*(Add this to `~/.bashrc`)*

'''

== The `PS1` Variable: Your Prompt

This variable controls what your command prompt looks like.

**Special Characters:**

* `\u` : Username
* `\h` : Hostname
* `\w` : Current Directory
* `\$` : `$` for normal users, `#` for root.

**Example:** `export PS1='[\u@\h \w]\$ '`
**Result:** `[user@hostname ~]$`

'''

== Lab Time!

. Open `~/.bashrc` with a text editor.
. Add the `ll` alias.
. Add the `mkcd` function.
. Add a custom `PS1` variable to make your prompt colorful.
** `export PS1='[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h[\033[00m]:[\033[01;34m\]\w[\033[00m]\$ '`
. Run `source ~/.bashrc`.
. Test that your alias, function, and new prompt all work correctly.
