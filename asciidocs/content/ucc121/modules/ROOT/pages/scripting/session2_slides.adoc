== From Consumer to Creator

=== UCC121 - Session 2

'''

== Today's Mission

[.invert]
====
We stop **typing** commands one by one.
We start **building** tools that work for us.

. **The Script Anatomy:** What makes a text file a program?
. **Permissions:** Why Linux blocks you (and how to fix it).
. **Variables:** Storing data like a pro.
. **Interaction:** Making scripts talk back.
====

'''

== 1. The Shebang (`#!`)

It's not just a hashtag. It's an instruction.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
echo "I am a script!"
----

* **`#`**: "Ignore this line" (Comment)
* **`!`**: "...except you, Operating System."
* **`/bin/bash`**: "Use this interpreter."

> **Rule:** Always the very first line. No spaces before it.

'''

== 2. Execution & Security

You created `myscript.sh`. You type `./myscript.sh`.
**Error:** `Permission denied`.

=== Why?
Linux assumes text files are for *reading*, not *running*. This prevents you from accidentally executing a love letter or a config file.

=== The Fix
[source,bash]
----
chmod +x myscript.sh
----
*(Change Mode: Add eXecute)*

'''

== 3. Variables: The Memory

Store data once, use it everywhere.

[source,bash]
----
# Define (NO SPACES!)
app_name="SuperApp"

# Use (Prefix with $)
echo "Deploying $app_name..."
----

'''

== The "Quotes" Trap ⚠️

This is where 90% of beginners fail.

|===
| Type | Symbol | Behavior | Example

| **Weak**
| `"`
| **Expands** variables
| `"Hi $user"` -> `Hi Marco`

| **Strong**
| `'`
| **Literal** text
| `'Hi $user'` -> `Hi $user`
|===

> **Pro Tip:** When in doubt, use Double Quotes `""`.

'''

== 4. Command Substitution

Want to save the *result* of a command?
Use **`$( command )`**.

**Bad (Old School):**
`now=`date`` (Don't use backticks!)

**Good (Modern):**
[source,bash]
----
now=$(date +%H:%M)
files=$(ls | wc -l)

echo "At $now, we have $files files."
----

'''

== 5. Interactivity

Stop hardcoding values. Ask the user.

[source,bash]
----
echo "Who are you?"
read username

echo "Welcome, $username. Let's work."
----

Or the compact version:
[source,bash]
----
read -p "Enter version: " version
----

== Live Coding

Let's put it all together.

'''

== Lab: The "Project Starter"

**Your Task:** Write a script `init_project.sh` that:

. Asks for a **Project Name**.
. Creates a folder with that name.
. Creates a `README.md` inside it.
. Writes a timestamped log entry into the README.
. Prints "Project [Name] initialized successfully."

**Commands you'll need:**
`read`, `mkdir`, `echo`, `date`, `chmod`
