= UCC121-3: AI In Administrative Tasks

== Course Information Sheet

* *Title:* AI In Administrative Tasks
* *Code:* UCC121-3
* *Prerequisites:* **UCC121-1**. Solid shell scripting skills.
* *Duration:* 12 hours (8 sessions of 1.5 hours each).
* *Objectives:*
** Use AI assistants to accelerate problem-solving and code generation.
** Apply AI to concrete use cases: log analysis, security, monitoring.
** Understand the principles of "prompt engineering" adapted to system tasks.
* *Assessment:* Continuous assessment (Practical Labs), project, final exam.

== 8-Session Breakdown

=== Session 1: Introduction to AI for System Administration

* *Lesson:* What is an LLM? Overview of AI tools for the CLI. Potential, limitations, and ethical considerations.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Installation and configuration of a tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot for CLI). First simple prompts.

=== Session 2: Command Generation and Explanation

* *Lesson:* The art of "prompting": how to translate a need into an effective AI query. Use cases: "explain this command," "find the command for...".
* *Lab/Assessment:* Series of challenges to be solved using AI to find and understand complex commands (`find`, `rsync`, `iptables`).

=== Session 3: AI-Assisted Script Generation

* *Lesson:* From a simple command to a complete script. How to specify the logic, error handling, and desired output format to the AI.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Generate a script that automates the creation of new users (with input validation).

=== Session 4: Iterative Code Refinement and Debugging with AI

* *Lesson:* Using AI as a "pair programming" partner. Submitting an existing script to improve, refactor, or debug it.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Take a simple script and ask the AI to add logging, better error handling, and comments.

=== Session 5: AI-Augmented Log Analysis

* *Lesson:* Strategies for analyzing large volumes of logs. Prompts for anomaly detection, activity summarization, and event correlation.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Analyze an `auth.log` to produce a security report (brute-force attempts, successful logins by user).

=== Session 6: AI for Configuration and Security

* *Lesson:* Generate configuration files (Nginx, Apache, SSH). Audit an existing configuration with AI to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Generate a secure Nginx configuration for a static website. Ask the AI to analyze `sshd_config` and suggest improvements.

=== Session 7: Concepts of Predictive Monitoring

* *Lesson:* Introduction to AIOps. How AI can analyze metrics (CPU, RAM) to anticipate problems. Designing intelligent alerts.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Use AI to write the metric collection script. Discuss data analysis strategies for this data with the AI.

=== Session 8: Synthesis Project and Future of AI

* *Lesson:* Reflection on the evolution of the system administrator profession.
* *Lab/Assessment:* Workshop dedicated to a final project combining scripting and AI (e.g., an intelligent system diagnostic tool) and presentation of results.
